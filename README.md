# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
This project will involve training a model to analyze movie reviews and predict whether the sentiment expressed in the review is positive or negative. The tool will use a dataset of labeled movie reviews to train a machine learning model, which can then be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews.
